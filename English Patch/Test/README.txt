Thank you for purchasing Police Quest Collection.  In order for you to 
receive the best possible performance with this adventure, Sierra has 
included additional technical tips and game information that was not 
available when the documentation was printed.  The following supplemental 
information should be considered part of the game documentation.

ABOUT THE COLLECTION
This is a collection of software spanning the first 10 years of the Police 
Quest series, the pinnacle of adventure games. This collection not only 
presents the compiled tales of the Police Quest saga, but also provides an 
example of the evolution of computer entertainment software over the last 
decade.

As you review early works of the Police Quest series, please remember that 
you are looking at what might be described as "digital antiques" from the 
early days of personal computing. Innovations such as mice and music cards, 
which are widely used today, were not yet available in the early and 
mid-1980's. Thus, early Police Quest games will not support them. We hope 
you will enjoy these games in the same nostalgic spirit as you would a 
classic black-and-white movie. While they may lack some modern-day 
technological flair, we think you'll agree that they do have a unique 
quality all their own.

It is also important to note that the Windows operating system was not in 
homes during the 80's. While we have attempted to adjust our software so that 
it may be accessed within Windows, some of the early games simply cannot run 
in Windows on some computer system configurations. If you are experiencing 
trouble with any adventure game while running within the Windows environment, 
we recommend that you exit Windows, and instead access the adventure game 
from MS-DOS.

IMPORTANT:
The police Quest Collection contains the complete series of all the Police 
Quest adventure games in one package.  In order to preserve the true look and 
feel of each product, we have included the original programs in the same 
format that they were released.  You will have problems attempting to run 
some of the earlier release of the Police Quest series under the Windows 
environment.  Therefore, we require that you run the earlier products 
directly under MS-DOS.  The following list contains the minimum system and 
operating for optimum game play:

ABOUT THE INTERFACE:  
The original Police Quest Adventures incorporated a "type-in" interface where 
you actually had to type in the commands in order to have the characters on 
the screen execute certain activity.  For example, if you were sitting in a 
chair and needed to stand, you would type: "stand up" or "get up" in order to 
complete this action.  The newer Police Quest adventures incorporate an icon 
interface for controlling the character.  In the newer titles, you would 
click on the Walk icon in the control icon interface and click the cursor on 
a certain section of the screen to stand and move to that location.  Please 
see the "Interface:" section in the requirement section above to see which 
products use the type-in interface and which use the icon interface.  The 
game documentation will outline the various methods of controlling each 
individual game.

INSTALLATION OF THE POLICE QUEST COLLECTION:
Although you can run the Windows SETUP program to install each of the games 
in the Police Quest Collection, a vast majority of the products will need to 
run under MS-DOS.  To install the games, launch Windows by typing: WIN <ENTER> 
at a DOS prompt.  Once in Windows, pull down the FILE menu in PROGRAM MANAGER 
and select the RUN option.  In the RUN window, type: D:/SETUP in the command 
line entry and press <ENTER>.  

NOTE: the above command assumes that your CD-ROM drive is labeled as your D 
drive.  If your CD-ROM is assigned a different drive letter, please 
substitute the appropriate letter in the statement above.

PERFORMANCE TIPS:

Problem: "General Protection Fault caused by GROWSTUB in POINTER.DLL" when 
game starts.
Explanation: This is caused by a Microsoft mouse driver version 9.01 GROWSTUB 
component.
Solution: One of the three suggestions should correct the problem.
   1. Remove POINTER.EXE from the load= line in the file WIN.INI and then 
      restart Windows.
   2. Download the file HD1061.EXE from the Microsoft BBS at (206) 936-6735.  
      This file is self-extracting.  Run "HD1061" and follow the instructions 
      in the newly created README.TXT file. 
   3. Upgrade to the Microsoft Mouse IntelliPoint software version 1.0.  For 
      information about obtaining this upgrade, call the Microsoft Sales 
      Information Center at (800) 426-9400. There is a charge for this 
      upgrade.

Problem:  Insufficient memory in Windows to play Police Quest Collection.
Explanation: Police Quest Collection was not able to find enough free memory 
on your computer to run the game properly.  Even though your computer might 
meet the system requirements to run the game, it may not have the memory set 
up correctly to run Police Quest Collection.
Solution:  Try the following suggestions:
   1: Make a boot disk.  
   2: Experiment with the VIRTUAL MEMORY setting if you are playing Police 
      Quest IV.  You might want to increase the size of your SWAP file. To do 
      this, go into Program Manager, and double-click on the Main Program 
      Group.  From this window, double-click on your Control Panel icon.  
      Within the Control Panel Window, double-click on the 386 Enhanced icon,
      and click on the Virtual Memory button.  Please consult your Windows
      documentation for information about configuring your SWAP file.

Problem:  Boot disk problems on a Western Digital IDE controller
Explanation:  The Western Digital IDE hard drive controller displays a 
message "Press the SPACEBAR to boot from a floppy disk."  If you insert the 
boot disk and reboot before seeing this message, you'll get the message 
"INVALID DRIVE SPECIFICATION," and won't have hard drive access until you 
reboot without the boot disk.   
Solution: Remove the boot disk from the floppy drive.  Reboot your computer.  
When you see this message, insert the boot disk and press the SPACEBAR.

Problem: Help setting up a MIDI MAPPER for extended FM cards when playing 
Police Quest IV.
Explanation: The Soundblaster 16, Pro Audio Spectrum 16, and compatibles 
support "Extended FM" in Windows.  "Base FM" uses MIDI MAPPER channels 13 to 
16.  "Extended FM" uses MIDI MAPPER channels 1 to 10.  To see how your MIDI 
Mapper is configured, Double Click on your MAIN program group from Program 
Manager.  When the MAIN window appears, double-click on the CONTROL PANEL 
icon.  From your Control Panel Window, select the MIDI MAPPER icon and click 
on the edit button.  You will see a Window appear that looks similar to the 
one that appears below.  This example illustrates how an Extended MIDI Mapper 
should be configured:  

 
<Graphics file can not be displayed in dos. Click on the readme icon in
 Windows to display this view.>


NOTE - the above example is simply included for demonstration purposes.  
Your MIDI Mapper may be configured with a different Port Name driver and/or 
may contain a Patch Map Name selection.  Please refer to your sound card 
documentation for information about configuring your specific MIDI Map.

Problem:  Police Quest IV play-screen is too small.
Explanation:  Police Quest IV was designed to play in a full screen with 
a 640X480 256 color Windows video driver.  If you have configured Windows to 
operate in a higher resolution (such as with an 800X600 256 color or 1024X768 
256 color driver), the game play area will appear smaller and will be 
surrounded by a black background.  
Solution:  In order to view the game in the full dimensions of your computer 
screen, you will need to load a 640X480 256 color video driver that is 
created for your specific brand of video card.  For more information about 
configuring Windows or obtaining this driver, please contact your video card 
manufacturer.


TECHNICAL TIPS

SECTION 1 - INSTALLATION PROCEDURES 

   Insert the CD into the appropriate drive.  From Program Manager, click on 
   File, then Run.  In the Command Line field, type the letter of the drive 
   followed by \SETUP.  Ex: D:\SETUP.  

SECTION 2 - COMMON INSTALLATION PROBLEMS

Problem:  Your computer fails the Sound Card test; you cannot hear the voice 
and fanfare in the Wave and MIDI tests. 
Solution:  Your sound card is incorrectly configured for Windows.  See 
Section 5, Sound Issues and Sound Card Settings for information on setting up 
your sound card.

Problem:  Your computer fails the Display test; you get a message saying 
"Your video display supports 16 colors...". 
Solution:  Sierra's Windows games require that Windows is running in 256 
color mode.  Even though your monitor and video card may be capable of 
displaying 256 colors, Windows may not be set up to use this resolution.  
To check, double-click on Windows Setup in the Main program group.  If the 
Display line reads "VGA" or "16 color," you will need to change to a driver 
that supports 256 colors.  ("VGA" is a default Windows video driver that only 
supports 16 colors and will not work with Sierra's Windows games.)  To change 
video drivers, select Options, then Change System Settings.  Open the Display 
box to see the list of video drivers that are currently available.   You 
should check your video card documentation for information on what 256 color 
driver to select.  

Warning: Be careful when changing video drivers!  If you choose one that is 
not designed for your particular video card, Windows will not display 
properly.  If this occurs, change to your Windows directory, type: SETUP, 
and choose the "VGA" driver again.  You should contact your video card 
manufacturer for the correct driver. 

Problem:  Your computer fails the Memory test; you get a message stating you 
do not have enough memory to run Police Quest Collection.
Solution:  First, create a Police Quest Collection boot disk using the 
instructions at the end of this document.  Reboot the system using the boot 
disk, then create a clean Windows environment.  Make sure that there are no 
other Windows programs running.  Disable all screen savers, virus scans, etc.  
If you are using an alternate Windows desktop (PC Tools, Dashboard, Packard 
Bell Navigator, etc.), use plain Program Manager instead.   If you have sound-
related Windows programs installed (IconHearIt, SoundBits, etc.), make sure 
they are disabled before starting the game.  Also, turn off your Wallpaper in 
Desktop in Control Panel.  Wallpaper can sometimes take up a considerable 
amount of memory.  These steps should give you enough memory to run the game.  
If they do not, please refer to Section 3, Memory Troubleshooting. 

Problem:  Police Quest Collection icon not created during game installation.  
Sierra group and other icons are created fine.  
Solution:  This is usually caused by an alternate Windows desktop, like 
Norton Desktop or PCTools.   You must disable these desktops before 
installing the game.   The easiest way to do this is to type PATH=C:\WINDOWS 
at the DOS prompt, then start Windows.  This should start Windows with 
Program Manager as the desktop.   When you are back in Windows, reinstall the 
game.  The icons will be created normally.   To restart Windows using your 
normal desktop, exit Windows and reboot the computer.  The next time you go 
into Windows, the alternate desktop will display.   PLEASE NOTE:  Police 
Quest Collection has not been tested under any alternate desktop environment, 
therefore Sierra cannot guarantee that the game will function properly under 
these desktops.


SECTION 3 - MEMORY TROUBLESHOOTING

Some game players have experienced difficulty getting enough memory to run 
Police Quest Collection - and more specifically Police Quest IV.  This 
usually occurs on computer systems with 4 Megabytes of RAM, but can happen on 
machines with more memory.  If you are having trouble starting the game 
because of memory problems or are receiving memory-related errors during the 
game (such as an "Out of Hunk" or "Out of Memory" message), here is a list of 
troubleshooting steps to try.

   Check the Swap File: If you are playing Police Quest IV through Windows, 
   establish a permanent swap file at about 6 MEGS.  This will help free up 
   memory.  Do not set the swap file too high, 6-8 MEGS permanent should be 
   enough.  Follow these steps to access and change the Windows swap file: 

   1. Close all Windows applications.

   2. Open the "Main" folder on your Windows desktop.

   3. Double-click on the "Control Panel" icon.

   4. Double-click on the "386 Enhanced" icon.

   5. Click on the "Virtual Memory . . ." button.

   6. Click on the "Change>>" button.

   7. Type "6000" in the "New Size" selection box, under the "New Settings" 
      heading.

   8. Select "Permanent" from the "Type" pull down combination box, if it is\ 
      available. If "Permanent" is not available, select "Temporary."

   9. If "32-bit File Access" is checked, un-check it.  This should remain 
      turned off.  If you have a "32-bit Disk Access" option, leave it 
      checked.

   10. Click the "OK" button.

   11. Click the "Restart Now" button.

   Windows will restart and take you back to the main Windows desktop. 

Create a Boot Disk:  Sierra has included a boot disk maker with Police Quest 
Collection.  The Boot Disk Creator is the last option available in the Setup 
program.  You can run it manually by double-clicking on the boot disk creator 
icon in the SIERRA program group.   In addition, instructions for creating a 
boot disk manually are included at the end of this troubleshooting guide.  
Try starting each game after re-booting with the boot disk.  

Select a Different Sound Option:  Try re-running the install program and 
select a different sound card configuration.  If you are using a sound 
blaster, try selecting the Ad-Lib option for the MS-DOS versions of the games.

Create a Clean Windows Environment:  Make sure that there are no other 
Windows programs running.  Disable all screen savers, virus scans, etc.  If 
you are using an alternate Windows desktop (PC Tools, Dashboard, Packard Bell 
Navigator, etc.), use plain Program Manager instead.   If you have sound-
related Windows programs installed (IconHearIt, SoundBits, etc.), make sure 
they are disabled before starting the game.  Also, turn off your Wallpaper 
in Desktop in Control Panel.  Wallpaper can sometimes take up a considerable 
amount of memory.  This will help if you have either setup problems and/or 
are having problems running Police Quest IV.

Turn Off 32-Bit File Accessing: Windows for Workgroups and Windows 3.11 
include a setting for 32-bit File Access in the Virtual Memory settings.  
This should be turned off.  If you are using Windows 3.1, you will see 32-bit 
Disk Access instead.  Leave this on. 

Windows for Workgroups v3.11: Because of Windows for Workgroups' memory 
requirements, you may experience trouble getting enough memory for the game 
if you have only 4 Megs of RAM.  If you are using Windows for Workgroups, we 
highly recommend that you have at least 8 Megs of RAM on your computer. 


SECTION 4 - COMMON GAME PROBLEMS

Problem:  When game starts, it displays a black screen or throws you out to 
DOS.
Solution:  Try creating a boot disk.  Running the game from the boot disk 
will usually correct this problem.  Please see "Create a Boot Disk" and 
"Create a Clean Windows Environment" under Section 3, Memory Troubleshooting.  
In addition, the problem may be caused by outdated or incompatible video or 
sound card drivers.  You should check with your video and sound card 
manufacturers to make sure you have the latest versions of their drivers.

Problem: "General Protection Fault in Module ... " The module name will vary.
Solution:  A General Protection Fault (GPF) in a module other than 
POINTER.DLL is usually caused by a memory conflict.  Make sure that there are 
no other Windows programs running.  Disable all screen savers, virus scans, 
etc.  If you are using an alternate Windows desktop (PC Tools, Dashboard, 
Packard Bell Navigator, etc.), use plain Program Manager instead.   If you
have sound-related Windows programs installed (IconHearIt, SoundBits, etc.), 
make sure they are disabled before starting the game.  

A Windows boot disk also helps with GPFs.  Instructions for creating a boot 
disk are at the end of this document.  GPFs can also be caused by outdated or 
incompatible sound or video drivers.  If the above steps do not solve the GPF 
for you, contact your video and sound card manufacturers to obtain the latest 
versions of their Windows drivers.

Problem: "EMM386 Error 06 ... " The error number may vary.
Solution:  This is caused by a memory conflict.  Running the game from the 
boot disk will usually correct this problem.  Please see "Create a Boot Disk" 
and "Create a Clean Windows Environment" under Section 3, Memory 
Troubleshooting.

Problem: "The instruction at (memory address) referenced memory at (memory 
address).  The memory could not be read from."
Solution:  This is called a "bad pointer."  It happens if you don't have the 
latest SoundBlaster 16 drivers for Windows. Download the file SB16UP.EXE from 
the Creative Labs BBS at (405) 742-6660.  This file is self-extracting.  Run 
"SB16UP" and follow the instructions in the newly created README.TXT file.  
If you do not have a modem, you can contact Creative Labs at (405) 742-6622 
and request the latest SoundBlaster 16 Windows drivers.  If you do not have a
SoundBlaster 16 card, the message probably indicates a memory conflict.  See 
Section 3, Memory Troubleshooting for information on resolving memory 
conflicts.

Problem:  When starting the game, you get "EMM386 Error 6 - No XMS memory".  
Solution:  Make a boot disk with the Boot Disk maker by double-clicking on 
the Boot Disk icon in the Sierra Group.  Or you can create a boot disk 
manually by following the instructions in section 3 of this document.  

Problem:  "Error 105: Attempt to load wrong type" or "Error 99: Error loading 
resource 10005."  Error numbers may vary.
Solution:  This type of error is usually caused by corrupted program files or 
a bad installation of the game.  To correct this, delete the game and run 
CHKDSK /F or SCANDISK to detect and correct any hard drive errors.  Then, 
boot up with a Police Quest Collection boot disk and reinstall the game in a 
clean Windows environment.  Please see "Create a Boot Disk" and "Create a 
Clean Windows Environment" under Section 3, Memory Troubleshooting for 
complete steps. 
 
If you don't see your question listed in this document:  Most difficulties 
with Police Quest Collection, including Fatal or Panic errors can be resolved 
by simply running the game with a boot disk and in a clean Windows 
environment.  Please see "Create a Boot Disk" and "Create a Clean Windows 
Environment" under Section 3, Memory Troubleshooting.


SECTION 5 - SOUND CARD CONFIGURATION AND SOUND ISSUES

The Soundblaster 16, Pro Audio Spectrum 16, and compatibles support "Extended 
FM" in Windows when running Police Quest IV.  SoundBlaster Pro, SoundBlaster 
2.0 and compatibles, use "Base FM" in Windows.  The Extended and Base FM 
settings are defined in the MIDI Mapper. 

Soundblaster 16, ProAudio Spectrum 16 and compatibles:  Click on MAIN, then 
Control Panel and then on MIDI Mapper.  If you have an option called Extended 
FM or something similar, choose it.  Close MIDI Mapper and run the Police 
Quest Collection program again.   If you don't have this option, you will 
need to make a new MIDI Mapper setup.  From the MIDI Mapper screen, click on 
New.  Enter a name such as "Extended FM" and then hit OK.  You will be at a 
screen with four columns and 16 rows.  Click on the word None in the 3rd 
column and the 1st row.  Now click on the small arrow that appears on the 
right of this box.  Choose the FM choice or Synthesizer choice.  Do this for 
ports 1 through 10.  Click on OK and close out the MIDI Mapper.  The music 
and voices should now play correctly in Police Quest Collection.  For further 
information on the correct MIDI Mapper configuration for your sound card, 
please contact your sound card manufacturer.

SoundBlaster Pro and compatibles:  
Click on MAIN, then Control Panel and then on MIDI Mapper.  If you have an 
option called Basic FM or something similar, choose it.  Close MIDI Mapper 
and run the Police Quest Collection program again.  If you don't have a Basic 
FM option you will need to make a new setup.  From the MIDI Mapper screen, 
click on New.  Enter a name such as "Basic FM" and then hit OK.  You will be 
at a screen with four columns and 16 rows.  Click on the word None in the 3rd 
column and the 13th row.  Now click on the small arrow that appears on the 
right of this box.  Choose the FM choice or Synthesizer choice.  Do this for 
ports 13, 14 , 15, and 16.  Click on OK and close out the MIDI Mapper.  The 
music and voices should now play correctly in Police Quest Collection.  For 
further information on the correct MIDI Mapper configuration for your sound 
card, please contact your sound card manufacturer.

MS-DOS Sound Card Configuration:
Because most of today's sound cards were not available when the older games 
on this CD were made, you may experience some problems when attempting to use 
various sound card drivers. Some cards may not work at all while other may 
work if you choose different sound options.  If you choose "SoundBlaster" and 
the game locks up or makes no sound at all, change the default sound option
settings to Adlib.  If all attempts fail, you may need to set the sound 
option to PC-Speaker.

   NOTE - Not all the products in the collection support sound.  Please 
   review the IMPORTANT notes section above for specific information about 
   the products that support sound cards.

If you have a listed card and still have problems, check your sound card 
settings. Try setting the DMA to 1, and the IRQ to 2, 5, 7, or 10. When one 
setting does not work, try the other settings.

If all else fails, you could try contacting your sound card manufacturer. 
They might have a utility or newer driver that makes your card emulate one 
of the cards we do support.  (Gravis owners can run SBOS to emulate a 
SoundBlaster.  Reveal owners can set their card to SoundBlaster mode or 
Microsoft Sound System.)  Chances are your manufacturer has better 
knowledge of your sound card than our Technical Support department.

Problem:  Starting the game gives you a "Waveout Open" or "Waveout Prepare 
Header" error message when playing Police Quest IV under Windows. 
Solution:  The Windows error message you are receiving indicates that your 
sound card is in use by another program.  This is occasionally caused by 
another sound program taking control in Windows and not sharing the sound 
card properly.  Programs like Icon Hear It, Wired for Sound or Packard Bell 
Navigator can cause this type of problem. Some screen savers like After Dark 
will also access the sound card directly instead of using Windows to produce 
sounds. You should disable all programs of this type before playing the game.

If you are still experiencing sound problems, you may need to update your 
sound drivers.  If you do not have the current Windows drivers for your sound 
device,  you may need to contact the manufacturer of your sound device or 
your local hardware supplier for an updated set of sound drivers.  Check your 
Windows documentation or your sound device documentation for full 
instructions on updating your sound drivers.

Problem:  When starting one of the MS-DOS application, I receive the error 
message "could not initialize sound/audio card".  
Solution:  Try selecting a different Sound Card driver option in the Install 
program.  If you are using a Sound Blaster Card, try selecting Ad-lib 
instead.  Police Quest I and Police Quest III do not use DAC for sampled 
sounds, so the Ad-Lib driver will sound 100% identical to the Sound Blaster 
driver. 


Police Quest Collection BOOT DISK INSTRUCTIONS

For IBM Compatibles using MS-DOS 5.0 or above and Windows 3.1 or higher:

The following instructions have been prepared by Sierra's Technical Support 
Department as an added service to our customers.  PLEASE NOTE: SIERRA DOES 
NOT MAKE ANY CLAIMS, GUARANTEES, AND/OR PROMISES THAT THE FOLLOWING 
INSTRUCTIONS WILL WORK ON ANY AND/OR ALL COMPUTER SYSTEMS.


STEP 1
FORMATTING THE DISK
PLEASE NOTE: It is necessary to format the disk even if the disk is already 
formatted.  The /S switch will transfer files to the boot disk which are 
necessary for the disk to work correctly.  To make a  CD-ROM Boot Disk, 
format a high density diskette in the A: drive.  (Use /F:360 or  /F:720 
parameter if using a low density diskette) For more information on using the 
FORMAT command, consult your DOS manual. Note: This will not work in the B: 
drive.  Type the command as follows: 

FORMAT  A:/S  <ENTER>

If after entering this command the system responds with a "Bad command or 
file name" error, then type:

PATH=C:\DOS  <ENTER>

Now retype the FORMAT command above.  If you still receive the same error, 
the MS DOS FORMAT command may not be on your system or it may have been 
renamed.  Programs such as PC Tools and Norton Disk Utilities can rename the 
format command to prevent accidental loss of data. If you are using a program 
like this, check your documentation to find out how to format a SYSTEM DISK, 
then proceed to Step 2.

STEP 2
LOCATING THE MSCDEX CD ROM EXTENSION 
MSCDEX is the Microsoft extension for CD ROM drives.  It must be loaded in 
order for your CD ROM drive to operate.  The following steps should assist 
you in locating this file on your system   To locate MSCDEX, at the C:\> 
prompt, type: TYPE  AUTOEXEC.BAT  |  MORE  <ENTER>

NOTE: The | is called a "pipe" command and is created by pressing <SHIFT> \ 
(backslash).  Now look for the line which loads "MSCDEX".  This line should 
look something like this: : 

C:\DOS\MSCDEX  /D:MSCD001
LH  C:\DOS\MSCDEX  /D:MSCD001
LOADHIGH  /L:14429  \DOS\MSCDEX  /D:MSCD001 

Your line may differ from the ones listed above.  Please write down the 
entire line following the drive letter in the space provided below.  Be sure 
and include the full drive and path to your MSCDEX file.  For example, any of 
the above lines should appear as follows:

C:\DOS\MSCDEX  /D:MSCD001                                                               

													

STEP 3
LOCATING THE CD ROM DEVICE DRIVER 
Along with MSCDEX, the CD ROM also needs a device driver.  This driver is 
loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file.   To determine the correct CD ROM device 
driver, at the C:\> prompt type:

TYPE  CONFIG.SYS  |  MORE  <ENTER>

NOTE: If you have a SCSI CD ROM drive, there may be an additional driver in 
your CONFIG.SYS that must be run for the CD ROM device drivers to load 
correctly.  Check your CD ROM drive documentation for more information. 

Now look for the line that contains CD ROM device name which immediately 
follows the same "/D:" switch as the MSCDEX line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  
Using the example above, we would be looking for a line containing "MSCD001".  
This line should look something like one of the following lines:

DEVICE=C:\DRV\CDROMDRV.SYS  /D:MSCD001  /P:220 
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DRV\CDROMDRV.SYS  /D:MSCD001  /P:220      
DEVICEHIGH  /L:14652  =C:\DRV\CDROMDRV.SYS  /D:MSCD001  /P:220

Your line may differ from the ones listed above.  Please write down the 
entire line following the drive letter in the space provided below.  Be sure 
and include the full drive and path to your CD ROM device driver.  For 
example, any of the above lines should appear as follows:       

DEVICE=C:\DRV\CDROMDRV.SYS  /D:MSCD001  /P:220                  

WRITE DOWN YOUR LINE IN THE SPACE PROVIDED BELOW:

DEVICE=

STEP 4
CREATING THE CONFIG.SYS FILE
Now switch to the A: drive and type the following:

COPY  CON  CONFIG.SYS <ENTER> (The cursor will drop down one line and blink)
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS  <ENTER>        
FILES=15  <ENTER>       
BUFFERS=10 <ENTER> 
DOS=HIGH  <ENTER>       

Now add the CD ROM driver line as you wrote it down in the "Locating the CD 
ROM device driver" section above.  Complete the file by pressing the  F6  
Function key <ENTER>

STEP 5
CREATING THE AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE
Now create an AUTOEXEC.BAT file by typing:

COPY  CON  AUTOEXEC.BAT   <ENTER> (the cursor will drop down one line)
ECHO OFF <ENTER>        
SET  COMSPEC=C:\COMMAND.COM  <ENTER>    
C: <ENTER>
PROMPT  SIERRA  CD  BOOT  DISK  $_$P$G  <ENTER> 
PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;  <ENTER>
C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE <ENTER>

Add the MSCDEX line as you wrote it down in the "Locating the MSCDEX CD ROM 
extension" section listed above.  

Complete the file by pressing the  F6  Function key <ENTER>

STEP 6
REBOOT THE SYSTEM
Reboot your system by depressing the <RESET> button on your computer or by 
using the <CTRL>, <ALT>, <DEL> key sequence on your keyboard.
