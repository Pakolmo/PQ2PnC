MIDI.EXE sysex  loader is used to  load patches for other  devices. Devices
supported in this manner:

Roland  D110       (Patches named: KQ5D110, QFG2D110, etc...)
Roland  D10/20     (Patches named: KQ5D20, QFG2D20, etc...)
EMU     Proteus/1  (Patches named: KQ5PRO1, QFG2PRO1, etc...)
EMU     Proteus/2  (Patches named: KQ5PRO2, QFG2PRO2, etc...)

These patches  must be loaded  into the device  before playing the  game by
using MIDI.EXE.  D-110/10/20's must always be  set to unit #18  in order to
receive the  sysex massage. EMU Proteus/1  & Proteus/2 must be  set to Unit
00. Run MIDI and load the appropriate  patch. Run the Sierra game using the
MT-32 driver.


NOTE: Casio  is not supported as  of yet in the  new system. However, there
are  plans  to  support  some  of  their  devices  in the future. The Music
Department will keep  the BBS up to date as  new drivers and patches become
available.
